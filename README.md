# Combined DCE and DSC Leakage Correction
Matlab code for correcting contrast leakage in DSC MRI using parameters derived from DCE MRI.

# Introduction
This repository contains Matlab code to estimate and compensate for contrast agent (GBCA) leakage in dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI. The correction leverages dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI‚Äìderived vascular parameters (e.g. Ktrans, vc and ve) to accurately model the tissue concentration and remove leakage-induced biases in DSC. By combining DCE and DSC analyses, the method aims to yield a more reliable DSC-based estimate in brain tumors or other pathologies.

# Instruction
The main.m demonstrates a full workflow using example data:
1. Loads or references DCE and DSC signal ratio curves, plus relevant protocol parameters (TR, TE, flip angles, T1 values, etc.).
2. Calls fit_sigR_DCE to estimate vascular permeability parameters (Ktrans, vc and ve) from the DCE data.
3. Calls fit_sigR_DSC to estimate tissue relaxivity (r2*) and post-preload tissue T1, using the DCE-derived parameters.
4. Performs the final leakage correction on the DSC data, generating corrected ŒîùëÖ2‚àó curves.
